Welcome to A Game Developer's Rant, a blog that'll make you hate games, and then
love them again.

There is a lot of stuff being set up on the blog at the momemt, and I'm afraid
that this land is as barren as it'll never be, but that's about it for now. I am
working as fast as I can to get it set up, and provide all game development
adventurers an open platform to gain knowledge of various things GameDev. ❤️
